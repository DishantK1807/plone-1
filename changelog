turnkey-plone-12.0 (1) turnkey; urgency=low

  * Initial public release of TurnKey Plone, based on TKLPatch submitted
    by Adrian Moya

  * Plone configured as ZeoCluster (better load balancing options, ability 
    to run scripts against live/development site, better debugging, reserve
    client for administrative access, etc...)

  * Configured Plone/Zeo services to bind to localhost, with Apache 
    rewriting URLS and proxying to the ZeoCluster.

  * Custom script to add Plone sites as Apache VirtualHosts (convenience).

  * Includes SSL support out of the box.

  * Regenerates all secrets during installation / firstboot (security).

  * Includes postfix MTA (bound to localhost) for sending of email (e.g.
    password recovery). Also includes webmin postfix module for convenience.

  * Major component versions

    plone           4.1.4 (upstream archive)
    apache2         2.2.16-6+squeeze7

  * Note: Please refer to turnkey-core's changelog for changes common to all
